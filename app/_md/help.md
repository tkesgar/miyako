Minakami is a small app to automatically share a Pixiv URL into various social media.

Currently we support sharing into Facebook and Twitter, with more coming soon.

## How to Use

- Paste your Pixiv post URL into the provided text box.
- Provide the social media accounts you want to use.
- Click the Share button.

If you check the "Perform a dry run" box, no actual posts will be created; instead, the app simply notifies you if the sharing is successful. This is useful for testing purposes.

Depending on the social media you've chosen, a number of permission pages will be shown before the shared post will be shown. This is one-time only, and the app won't ask your permission again the next time. However, you **must** accept all the permissions so the app can continue.
