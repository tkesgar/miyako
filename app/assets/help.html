<p>Minakami is a small app to automatically share a Pixiv URL into various social media.</p>
<p>Currently we support sharing into Facebook and Twitter, with more coming soon.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use">How to Use</h2>
<ul>
<li>Paste your Pixiv post URL into the provided text box.</li>
<li>Provide the social media accounts you want to use.</li>
<li>Click the Share button.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you check the &quot;Perform a dry run&quot; box, no actual posts will be created; instead, the app simply notifies you if the sharing is successful. This is useful for testing purposes.</p>
<p>Depending on the social media you&#39;ve chosen, a number of permission pages will be shown before the shared post will be shown. This is one-time only, and the app won&#39;t ask your permission again the next time. However, you <strong>must</strong> accept all the permissions so the app can continue.</p>
